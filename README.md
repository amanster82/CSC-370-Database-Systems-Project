# CSC-370-Database-Systems-Project


This was a project created for CSC 370: Database System course @ UVIC. The project was to design a system for an international airport
that wants to keep track of flights.

The system was introduced as a web application that is backed by the ORACLE database and utilizes the Structured-Query-Language (SQL) and
is documented using E/R diagrams (Entity-Relationship Model) .
There exits three development environments in this project: 

(1) Code written in Java backed by Servlets utilized to communicated with the ORACLE DBMS 
(2) Script.js code invented as a middle-tier parser to interepret post/get requests from HTML radio buttons 
(3) A UI (userinterface) created via HTML/CSS utilizing the bootstrap framework

There also exists code utilized to create tables in the ORACLE DBMS (Create table statements...etc) when creating the database.
The web server utilized in this project is Apache Tomcat version 6.0.18, and has been configured to work on localhost:9000.
